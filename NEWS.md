### API compatibility

 * Id part of "DocService/Arn", "SearchService/Arn", and "DomainId" of
   "DomainStatus" are now returned with the value different from the domain id
   string in the endpoint host name correctly. You always need to refer
   "DocService/Endpoint" or "SearchService/Endpoint" to know endpoint host
   names.
 * DefineIndexField never merge newly specified options with previously defined options.
   (In other words, now DefineIndexField always clear old options.)

   API are still returned in JSON.)

   from existing SDF file.
 * The option "--base-host" for the command bin/gcs is now obsolete.
   You don't need to give host name of the server to the server process anymore.
 * gcs-configure-fields now accept multiple "--option" options, like:
   
       $ gcs-configure-fields -d domain --name field --type literal --option search result
   
   or
   
       $ gcs-configure-fields -d domain --name field --type literal --option search --option result

### Daemon
